Alcohol use in young people remains an important public health issue. Understanding the risk factors for developing harmful drinking behavior from adolescence to adulthood is vital to develop targeted prevention and intervention programs. One important risk factor may be the tendency to value immediate rewards relative to delayed rewards. A persistent preference for smaller, immediate rewards, measured via temporal discounting (TD) paradigms, may reflect impulsive decision-making. TD has been associated with greater substance use in adolescents and young adults. Identifying the functional relationship between TD and patterns of alcohol consumption may yield novel insights into the development of problematic substance use during adolescence. 

A total of 197 healthy adolescents and young adults (108 F) aged 9-23 years (mean = 16.45, SD = 4.1) were invited to participate in a 10-year, 5-visit longitudinal study of brain and cognitive development. Participants, many of whom were substance naive at the study baseline, completed a temporal discounting task and assessments of substance use assessment at each visit. Temporal discounting was quantified by area-under-the-curve (AUC) when plotting indifference points against each temporal delay interval. Lower AUCs reflect greater discounting behaviors. At each visit, self-reported alcohol use frequency, and the quantity of alcohol consumed over the past 12 months was collected. Age-related changes in TD and alcohol use patterns were separately quantified using generalized additive mixture models (GAMMs). The relationship between alcohol frequency and alcohol quantity with AUC were considered separately, while also accounting for age.

Aligning with previous research and our expectation, AUC scores increased as participants aged, with scores reaching asymptote by early adulthood. Both the quantity and frequency of alcohol use increased as a function of age until approximately age 22, when these behaviors reached a plateau. Further, the relationship between AUC was moderated by biological sex with males drinking more than females after approximately age 18 in our sample. The degree to which participants drank varied as a function of AUC: participants with greater temporal discounting drank more than those with reduced temporal discounting. 

This study affirms the utility of temporal discounting as an important individual difference factor and vulnerability marker for higher quantities of alcohol consumption during adolescence and young adulthood.
