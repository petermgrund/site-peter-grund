Few places in the U.S. are more associated with Lutheranism than Minnesota. Swedish, Norwegian, German, and other European settlers arriving in the mid- to late 19th and early 20th century brought with them their religious heritage and established distinct Lutheran congregations and church bodies based on ethnic identification. As decedents became more integrated into American culture, Lutheran bodies became less associated with specific national origins and prioritized common geography and theology.  For example, the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America and Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America merged in 1962 to form the theologically liberal Lutheran Church in America (LCA). In 1988, the Evangelical [Lutheran Church in America](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lutheran-Church-in-America) (ELCA) was formed in 1988 by the merger of two major Lutheran denominations, the [American Lutheran Church](https://www.britannica.com/topic/American-Lutheran-Church) and the [Lutheran Church in America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheran_Church_in_America), making ELCA the largest Lutheran denomination in the United States.

At this time, Minnesota had the largest number of baptized ELCA members in the U.S. by raw numbers (805,000), or nearly 19% of the state's total population. 29% of North Dakotans were members (185,000).

 However, membership in ELCA has steadily declined in Minnesota, both in terms of members and what percentage of the population they represent. Today, only around 11% of Minnesotans are members.

Raw membership numbers tell a more nuanced story. ELCA numbers were slowly growing in MN until the turn of the century, at which point the trend reversed. The significant drop seen in 2009 can largely be attributed to the adoption of a same-gender relationship social policy. Looking at the decline in the decade prior to the policy, it seems apparent that while the policy led to a major one time drop in membership, it did not significantly increase the rate at which decline had been occuring.

Between 2009 and 2010, ELCA lost over 57,000 members in MN, or around 7% of all members. Since then, they have been losing a little over 10,000 members per year, slightly more per year than occurred the decade preceding the policy, but not significantly so.

Below, we can see that the number attending weekly ELCA services across MN remained steady up until 2000.

Now, let's look at regional differences. Minnesota is split into 6 separate synods. The number of members in each were remaining steady (and even growing in Saint Paul) as recently as 2001. The impact of the 2009 resolution can easily be seen in the larger synods.

Shown below is the number of weekly attenders per synod. With headlines such as '[Will the ELCA be Gone in 30 Years?](https://faithlead.luthersem.edu/decline/)', it's shocking to me that congregations in the Minneapolis and Saint Paul Area were still growing just 20 years ago.

However, signs of decline could be seen earlier. The graph below shows the percent of baptized members attending weekly services. In '87, the average across all synods was about 30%. That has since dropped 10 pts.
