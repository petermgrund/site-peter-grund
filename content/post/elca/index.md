Few places in the U.S. are more associated with Lutheranism than Minnesota. Swedish, Norwegian, and German settlers arriving in the late 19th and early 20th century brought with them their religious affiliation, establishing many Lutheran congregations. Over time, different Lutheran bodies 

However, membership in the largest Lutheran church, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), has steadily declined in Minnesota since 1987; from nearly 19% of the population, to 11% in 2019.

Raw membership numbers tell a more nuanced story. ELCA was slowly growing in MN until the turn of the century, at which point the trend reversed. The significant drop seen in 2009 can largely be attributed to the adoption of a same-gender relationship social policy.

Between 2009 and 2010, ELCA lost over 57,000 members in MN, or around 7% of all members. Since then, they have been losing a little over 10,000 members per year.

The number attending weekly ELCA services across MN remained steady up until 2000.

Now, let's look at regional differences. Minnesota is split into 6 separate synods. The number of members in each were remaining steady (and even growing in Saint Paul) as recently as 2001. The impact of the 2009 resolution can easily be seen in the larger synods.

Shown below is the number of weekly attenders per synod. With headlines such as 'Will the ELCA be Gone in 30 Years?', it's shocking to me that congregations in the Minneapolis and Saint Paul Area were still growing just 20 years ago.

However, signs of decline could be seen earlier. The graph below shows the percent of baptized members attending weekly services. In '87, the average across all synods was about 30%. That has since dropped 10 pts.
